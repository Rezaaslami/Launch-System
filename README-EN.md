# Voting System

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that allows users to vote for one of three people (Ali, Sara, or Reza) and leave a comment. Each user can vote only once, and their vote and comment are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.

## Features

- Display of candidates with photos and vote buttons
- Requires users to enter a comment when voting
- Saves vote and comment using localStorage
- Disables voting after one submission
- Real-time vote count display
- Simple and clean design in Persian

## Requirements

No special requirements. Just open the file in any modern browser.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Choose one of the candidates and enter a comment.
3. Click the vote button.
4. Your vote will be saved and the results will be updated.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main file containing HTML, CSS styles, and JavaScript
- Images (e.g., `1 (1).jpg`, `1 (1).png`, `1 (2).jpg`) should be placed in the same directory as the HTML file

## Notes

- Users can only vote once (based on localStorage)
- Votes and comments are preserved after page refresh
